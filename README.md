# coding_resources

A list of resources that I have found helpful for learning to code. It is largely geared towards R at the moment due to my usage.

### R

* __Where to start__
  * What is R https://www.r-project.org/ 
  * Download R (and extra packages) https://cran.r-project.org/
  * Download RStudio - a desktop app (also known as an "interactive development environment" or IDE) which makes working with R a lot nicer than not having an IDE (it will help you organise your code, data and plots) https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/

* __General R tutorials__
  * I learnt R using a free online course that no longer exists. But plenty of others do.
  * See Data Science Guide for a great list https://github.com/Chris-Engelhardt/data_sci_guide 
  * See How to Learn R for a nice intro https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/
  * Swirl (is an R package for interactive R learning) https://swirlstats.com/students.html 
  * R For The Rest Of Us (looks good) https://rfortherestofus.com/ 
  * R manual (a little dry for the beginner) https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html 

* __Specific R tutorials__ (for applications relevant to biologists)
  * __R for Data Science__ https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html
    * don't worry about the name, Data Science is just the name given to any task that deals with (a) importing (b) analysing (c) plotting/visualising data (ie. everything you might use Excel for). this is an everyday thing for biologists, you don't need to be dealing with terabytes of data to need these tools.
  * __ggplot2__ probably the major package in the life of experimentalists with a requirement for data visualisation. start here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/
  * __R for Biochemists__
    * blog: http://rforbiochemists.blogspot.com/ 
    * course: https://biochemistry.org/events/r-for-biochemists-101-sept-2019/ a layperson's course run specifically to familiarise biochemists with R and deals with the basics of R, data import, plotting (eg. RNAseq log2 plots and enzyme kinetics data) and curve fitting.

* __Reference sheets__
  * ggplot2 cheat sheet https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf & functions https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ & cookbook http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/
  * other cheat sheets https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

### Matlab, Python and other languages

Curated lists of courses (online and in person) can be found here:

* Data Science Guide https://github.com/Chris-Engelhardt/data_sci_guide 
* Coder Newbie Advice https://github.com/charlottebrf/coder-newbie-advice

### Markdown

Text writing/editing designed to be flexible and adopted by many platforms (eg GitHub), convertible, and easily readable. More flexible than Word, simpler to learn than HTML or LaTeX.

* Markdown reference https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
* GitHub flavor markdown https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax 
* R markdown reference https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html & https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf
* R markdown examples - used for reports, data analysis workflows, lab notebooks.. https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html

---

### GitHub

I'd recommend working through something on command line like in Blischak's paper to start. For most applications however, I'd use GitHub Desktop, a much nicer interface than command line.

* Blischak 2016: A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668
* GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/ & https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop

---

### Troubleshooting 

* Google first!
* Most Google queries link me to:
  * StackOverflow https://stackoverflow.com 
  * STHDA http://www.sthda.com/english/
  * Data Novia blog https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/

### Organisations focused on education & community-building in coding/data science

* R-Ladies https://rladies.org/
* R4DS https://twitter.com/r4dscommunity
* Researc/Hers Code https://www.researcherscode.com/
* #tidytuesday https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday
